Generate New Maps 

Context 

	Player has completed an existing map or triggers an event requiring a new map(eg., start of the game or end). 
	The game has a system to procedurally or manually generate new maps. 

Primary Flow 

	1. User reaches a point where a new map is needed (e.g., completes old map, selects "Generate New Map" action). 
	
	2. System generates a new map based on predefined parameters (e.g., difficulty, theme, hazards, short or long). 
	
	3. System updates the player’s location to the starting point of the new map. 
	
	4. System displays the description of the new location and available actions. 

Alternative Flows 

	 New map generation fails (e.g., corrupted or incomplete parameters): 
	 
		A3. System detects an error in map generation. 
		
		A4. System displays an error message and provides options (e.g., retry, load default map). 
		
		A5. System returns to the primary flow’s step 3 after resolving the issue. 
		
	 Player cancels new map generation: 

		A2. User decides not to proceed with new map generation (e.g., selects "Cancel" option). 
		
		A3. System regenerates the current map. 
		
		A4. System returns to primary flow's step 3
