Interact with an NPC at a Location 

Context 

	Player is in a location with one or more NPCs. 
	NPC interaction may involve dialogue, trading, or triggering quests. 

Primary Flow 

	1. System displays the available interaction options (e.g., talk, trade, fight, accept quest). 
	
	2. User selects an interaction option. 
	
	3. System processes the selected interaction (e.g., updates dialogue, starts a trade, initiates combat). 
	
	4. System updates player status, inventory, or quest log based on the interaction outcome. 
	
	5. System displays a message or changes based on the outcome of the interaction. 
	
Alternative Flows
 
	NPC has no interaction options available: 
	
		A3. System detects the NPC has no available interactions (e.g., already talked, traded, or completed quest). 
		
		A4. System displays a message indicating no interaction is possible. 
		
		A5. System returns to the primary flowâ€™s step 5. 

	NPC interaction fails (e.g., insufficient resources): 
	
		A4. System checks the requirements for the selected interaction. 
		
		A5. System determines the player does not meet the requirements (e.g., lacks currency or items). 
		
		A6. System returns to the primary flow's step 5.
