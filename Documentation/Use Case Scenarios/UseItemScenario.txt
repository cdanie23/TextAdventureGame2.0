Use Item from Inventory

Context

	The player has one or more items in their inventory.

	Items can have specific effects depending on the context (e.g., healing health, poisoning an enemy, or dealing damage).

	The current location, player status, or presence of enemies may require item use.

Primary Flow

	User selects an item from the inventory.

		System verifies that the item can be used in the current context:

			For example, a healing potion can only be used if the player's health is not full, or a weapon can only be used if there is an enemy present.

		System applies the item's effect:

			Healing Potion: Increases the player's health.

			Poison Potion: Deals damage to an enemy over time.

			Weapon/Attack Item: Deals instant damage to an enemy.

		System updates the player's status, inventory, and/or enemy's status based on the item's effect:

			Healing Potion: Updates the player's health and removes the potion from the inventory.

			Poison Potion: Applies a poison status effect to the enemy and removes the potion from the inventory.

			Weapon/Attack Item: Reduces the enemy's health and updates its status.

		System displays the updated item status, player status, or enemy status.

		System identifies and displays available actions based on the updated location, player status, or enemy's status.

Alternative Flows

		A2. System checks the rules for item usage and determines the item cannot be used.

		A3. System displays a message indicating the item cannot be used in the current context.

		A4. System returns to the primary flow’s step 6.

	Healing Potion Scenario:

		A3. System applies the potion’s effect, increasing the player’s health by a specified amount (e.g., +50 health).

		A4. System updates the player’s status:

			For example: If the player had 70/100 health and the potion heals 50, the player’s health becomes 100/100 (but not above max health).

		A5. System removes the used potion from the inventory.

		A6. System displays a players health message.

		A7. System identifies and displays updated actions based on the player’s new health status.

	Poison Potion Scenario:

		A2. System detects that there is an enemy present and verifies that the poison potion can be applied to the enemy.

		A3. System applies the poison potion’s effect.

		A4. System updates the enemy’s health and status.

		A5. System removes the used poison potion from the inventory.

		A6. System displays a enemy damaged message.

		A7. System identifies and displays updated actions based on the enemy’s poisoned status.

	Damaging an Enemy Scenario (Using a Weapon):

		A2. System detects that there is an enemy present and verifies that the selected item (e.g., a sword) can be used to deal damage.

		A3. System applies the damage effect to the enemy:

			For example: A sword deals -20 damage to the enemy’s health.

		A4. System updates the enemy’s health:

			For example: If the enemy had 100/100 health, it is now reduced to 80/100.

		A5. System displays the updated enemy status:

			For example: "You attacked the enemy with your sword. Enemy health: 80/100."

		A6. System checks the enemy’s health:

			If the enemy’s health reaches 0 or below, the enemy is defeated, and the player gains rewards (e.g., coins or items).

			Otherwise, the enemy attacks back, reducing the player’s health.

		A7. System displays the result of the enemy’s counterattack (if applicable) and identifies updated actions for the player.
