Use Item from Inventory 

Context 

	Player has one or more items in their inventory. 

	The current location and/or player status may require the use of an item (e.g., healing potion, key for a door). 

Primary Flow 

	1. User selects an item from the inventory. 

	2. System verifies that the item can be used in the current context. 

	3. System applies the itemâ€™s effect (e.g., heals health, unlocks a door). 

	4. System updates the player status and/or location based on the effect of the item. 

	5. System displays updated status or new location description. 

	6. System identifies available actions based on updated status/location and inventory. 

Alternative Flows 

	Item cannot be used in the current context: 

		A2. System checks item usage rules and determines the item cannot be used. 

		A3. System displays a message indicating the item is not usable in the current context. 

		A4. System returns to the primary flow's step 6.
