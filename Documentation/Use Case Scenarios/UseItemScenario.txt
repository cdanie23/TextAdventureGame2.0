Use Item from Inventory 

Context 

	Player has one or more items in their inventory. 

	The current location and/or player status may require the use of an item (e.g., attacking an enemy). 

Primary Flow

	2. System verifies that the item can be used in the current context(e.g., an enemy can be attacked)

	3. System applies the itemâ€™s effect (e.g., heals health, damages an enemy). 

	4. System updates the player status and/or enemies based on the effect

	5. System displays updated item status or enemy status

	6. System identifies available actions based on updated status of location or enemies

Alternative Flows 

	Item cannot be used in the current context: 

		A2. System checks item usage rules and determines the item cannot be used. 

		A3. System displays a message indicating the item is not usable in the current context. 

		A4. System returns to the primary flow's step 6.
